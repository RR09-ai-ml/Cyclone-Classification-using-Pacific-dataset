# Cyclone-Classification-using-Pacific-dataset
In this project, we classified tropical cyclones in the Pacific Ocean using meteorological data to predict their intensity and categorize them into different storm types.


This Project involves analyzing data from tropical cyclones that form over the Pacific Ocean to categorize them based on their intensity, size, and other key characteristics. The dataset typically includes meteorological variables such as wind speed, pressure, temperature, and location, along with time-series data capturing the cyclone's development and trajectory.

The classification process often uses machine learning techniques, such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), or deep learning models, to classify cyclones into different categories, such as tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes/typhoons, depending on their strength. Advanced statistical methods or AI models can also help predict future cyclone behavior or detect patterns that could improve early warning systems and disaster preparedness.

By analyzing the Pacific dataset, researchers and meteorologists can improve cyclone tracking, enhance forecasting models, and mitigate the impact of cyclones on vulnerable coastal regions.
